# peoplearerad
Student Project for Cyberwizard Institute

goal: To build a randomized video-server showcasing people being awesome, ideally for use in response to folks in bad moods who happen to declare "people suck!" Using basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript and other newly aquired skills, i hope to create a site that challenges misanthropic moods & opinions. 

eventual home: www.PeopleAreRad.com
